## Random Quotes Machine

This project initializes freeCodeCamp Front End libraries certification projects.

To get this machine working, I used jQuery / JavaScript and Sass for styling.

In the `index.js` file, you can find all the code that makes the machine work properly  
and in `quotesBank.js` file, there's an array with 35 objects  
that contains quote and author keys.
